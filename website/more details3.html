    <p><b><ul>The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high.</ul>
                    <ul>Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome)</ul>
                    <ul>The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height.</ul>
                    <ul>The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape of the main dome. </ul>
                    <ul>The dome is slightly asymmetrical Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior. </ul>
                    <ul>The lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. </ul>
                    <ul>The dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani decorative elements.

    <p><b><ul>The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century</ul>
        <ul>This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional Persian and Hindu decorative elements. The finial is topped by a moon, a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.</ul>
        <ul>The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minaretsâ€” a traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic faithful to prayer. </ul>
        <ul>. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial. The minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse, a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period, the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb</ul>
            <ul>The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. The decorative elements were created by applying paint, stucco, stone inlays or carvings.

        <p><b><ul>Abstract forms are used throughout, especially in the plinth, minarets, gateway, mosque, jawab and, to a lesser extent, on the surfaces of the tomb. </ul>
            <ul>The domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms. Herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements</ul>
            <ul>White inlays are used in sandstone buildings, and dark or black inlays on the white marbles. Mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex array of geometric patterns. </ul>
            <ul>the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines. The marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings. The dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised, almost geometric vines, flowers and fruits. </ul>
                <ul>The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.</ul>
